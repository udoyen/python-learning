The issue with the code is that the parameter `rhs: Ingredient` in the `__add__` method is not recognized because `Ingredient` is not fully defined at the time when the method is being written. This happens because the method is within the `Ingredient` class, which is still being defined.

To fix this, you can use a forward reference by placing `Ingredient` in quotes. This tells Python to treat `Ingredient` as a string and to resolve it later once the class definition is complete.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, Tuple

# Assuming ImperialMeasure is already defined somewhere else
class ImperialMeasure:
    CUP = "cup"
    TABLESPOON = "tablespoon"
    TEASPOON = "teaspoon"

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Ingredient:
    name: str
    brand: str
    amount: float = 1
    units: ImperialMeasure = ImperialMeasure.CUP
    
    def __add__(self, rhs: 'Ingredient'):  # Use a forward reference for Ingredient
        # make sure we are adding the same ingredient
        assert (self.name, self.brand) == (rhs.name, rhs.brand)
        
        # build up conversion chart (lhs, rhs): multiplication factor
        conversion: Dict[Tuple[ImperialMeasure, ImperialMeasure], float] = {
            (ImperialMeasure.CUP, ImperialMeasure.CUP): 1,
            (ImperialMeasure.CUP, ImperialMeasure.TABLESPOON): 16,
            (ImperialMeasure.CUP, ImperialMeasure.TEASPOON): 48,
            (ImperialMeasure.TABLESPOON, ImperialMeasure.CUP): 1 / 16,
            (ImperialMeasure.TABLESPOON, ImperialMeasure.TABLESPOON): 1,
            (ImperialMeasure.TABLESPOON, ImperialMeasure.TEASPOON): 3,
            (ImperialMeasure.TEASPOON, ImperialMeasure.CUP): 1 / 48,
            (ImperialMeasure.TEASPOON, ImperialMeasure.TABLESPOON): 1 / 3,
            (ImperialMeasure.TEASPOON, ImperialMeasure.TEASPOON): 1
        }
        
        # Convert the amounts and return a new Ingredient with the summed amount
        return Ingredient(
            rhs.name,
            rhs.brand,
            rhs.amount + self.amount * conversion[(rhs.units, self.units)],
            rhs.units
        )
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Forward Reference in `__add__`:** The string `'Ingredient'` is used as a forward reference to refer to the `Ingredient` class within the same class definition.
- **Conversion Dictionary:** The `conversion` dictionary remains the same, defining how to convert between different units.

### **Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that `ImperialMeasure` is defined before you use it in `Ingredient`. The example assumes that `ImperialMeasure` is a class or enum defined elsewhere.
- The `dataclass(frozen=True)` decorator is used, making the `Ingredient` instances immutable. This is useful for cases where you don't want the attributes of an instance to be changed after creation.
