# The typechecker will detect that a BLTSandwich is Splittable just by virtue of the
# fields and method it has defined. This simplifies class hierarchies immensely. You
# donâ€™t need a complicated tree structure, even as you add more protocols. You can
# simply define a different protocol for each set of required behaviors, including Sharea
# ble, Substitutable, or PickUppable. Functions that depend on those behaviors can
# then rely on those protocols instead of any sort of base class. The original classes
# donâ€™t need to change in any form, as long as they implement the needed functionality.
